Many of us use an online calendar provided by Google, Apple, or Microsoft. We might have some concerns about how they use the data we give them, but these calendar apps are just so darn convenient... They're well-supported, ubiquitous, and integrated into any website or service that has an event or task to schedule.

They don't cost any money. That means **you** are the product.

It doesn't have to be that way! We can have a calendar that's easy to use, available online or offline, easy to use with third-party sites/services, easy to export/import data, and doesn't make *you* the product.
